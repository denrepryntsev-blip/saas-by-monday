# Getting Started

This guide will help you go from **zero to a running project** in minutes,
while keeping the architecture intact and AI under control.

You don’t need to understand everything upfront.
You just need to follow the sequence.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18+
- Git
- A GitHub account
- Cursor installed (recommended)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript / TypeScript

No prior SaaS architecture experience is required.

cd ai-saas-foundation
