# AI SaaS Foundation

This is not a boilerplate.

This foundation is designed to help you **build real SaaS products with AI**
without losing structure, safety, or long-term velocity.

You are not starting from zero.
You are starting from a **deliberate architecture**.

---

## What this foundation solves

Building with AI is fast — until it isn’t.

Most AI-generated projects fail because:
- architecture drifts over time
- boundaries between features disappear
- code becomes hard to reason about
- refactoring becomes risky suggesting "rewrite everything"

This foundation exists to **prevent that from happening**.

---

## How this foundation is different

This project is built around three core principles:

### 1. Architecture comes first
The structure of the codebase is intentional.
Features have clear boundaries.
AI is guided — not unleashed.

### 2. AI is a collaborator, not an author
Cursor is expected to:
- follow rules
- respect boundaries
- explain before changing structure

You remain the architect.
AI becomes a force multiplier.

### 3. Docs are part of the system
Documentation is not an afterthought.
It is part of the architecture.

These docs are written to be:
- readable by humans
- understandable by AI
- stable over time

---

## How to use this documentation

If you just purchased the foundation:

1. Start with **Getting Started**
2. Read **Architecture Overview**
3. Study **Cursor Rules**
4. Follow the **AI PRD format**

If you are already building:
- use these docs as a reference
- copy prompts directly into Cursor
- keep architecture decisions aligned

---

## What you should NOT do

To get the most value from this foundation, avoid:
- asking AI to “just make it work”
- bypassing existing modules
- changing core structure without understanding it
- mixing unrelated concerns in the same feature

Speed without structure is debt.
This foundation is built for **sustained speed**.

---

## Final note

Think of this project as a **system**, not a template.

If you respect the system:
- AI will stay useful
- complexity will stay manageable
- your product will stay evolvable

The goal is not to ship once.

The goal is to keep shipping.
